Module 6

In the attached repository you will find both : Weather.py and Vacation.py

In Weather.py- I had an issue printing out the linear regression equation on the graph. I am unsure why this was being that the code was the same throughout this section (adjusted for variables). The following is included using the citypy API:
  - Data retrieval for the cities list generated in the starter code
  - Scatter Plots plotting Latitude vs the following variables: Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind 
    Speed
  - These variable are then charted for linear regression. Each variable has a graph for both- Northern and 
    Southern Hemishperes

There are no issues that I am aware of in Vacation.py. The following is included using the geoapify API:
  - Data retrieval for weather and coordinates data and creating a dataframe with the information
  - Narowing the df to self made criteria of ideal weather conditions
  - Data for the hotels near the filtered data for ideal weather
  - A heatmap of the cleaned data
